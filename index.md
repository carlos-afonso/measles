Transforming raw data into visualizations that help understand the current Measles Outbreak.

# New York City (NYC)

NYC provides raw data about the number of Measles Cases by Neighborhood, Age and Date on its [NYC Health Measles webpage](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/measles.page){:target="&#95;blank" rel="noopener"}. Here we visualize that data.

## NYC Measles Cases by Neighborhood

The animated GIF below shows the NYC Measles Cases by Neighborhood, contrasting the number of the **all** the cases since the beginning of the outbreak (from 1 Sep 2018 to 29 Apr 2019) with the number of the **new(est)** cases (from 23 to 29 Apr 2019) -- the animation alternates every 3 seconds.

The image below shows the same two images shown in the animated GIF above, but now showing them in a static form, side-by-side.

Additional note about the visualizations above:
* As per the NYC Health data, the following three sets of neighborhoods have their case counts merged: a) "Coney Island" / "Brighton Beach", b) "Midwood" / "Marine Park", and c) "Melrose" / "Longwood" / "Hunts Points".
