# Visualizing the 2019 Measles Outbreak

The goal of this webpage is to help inform the public about the current Measles Outbreak, by transforming the Measles raw data into helpful visualizations.

This webpage is a work in progress. At the moment, it contains visualizations about New York City only, but more locations will be added soon.

# New York City (NYC)

New York City (NYC) provides excellent data about its current Measles Outbreak on its [NYC Health Measles webpage](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/measles.page){:target="&#95;blank" rel="noopener"}. Moreover, the data seems to be update regularly, at least once a week. So, the visualizations in this webpage will be updated accordingly.

Specifically, NYC provides tables with the number of measles cases by neighborhood, age and date. The next sections present the visualizations for this data.
