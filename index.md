Helping understand the current measles outbreak by transforming its raw data into visualizations.

## New York City (NYC)

NYC provides raw data about the number of measles cases by neighborhood, age and date on its [NYC Health Measles webpage](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/measles.page){:target="&#95;blank" rel="noopener"}. This section presents visualizations of that data, to help understand the current NYC measles outbreak.

### NYC Measles Cases by Neighborhood

To help understand the geographic distribution of the measles outbreak, the visualizations below highlight the locations of the affected neighborhoods on the NYC map, with colors representing the number of cases.

The animation below shows the NYC measles cases by neighborhood, alternating (every 7 seconds) between the number of **all** cases since the beginning of the outbreak (from 1 Sep 2018 to 29 Apr 2019) and the number of the **newest** cases (from 29 Apr to 6 May 2019). The visualization immediately after shows these same two maps but now in a static form, side-by-side. (To better see the side-by-side maps when using a phone, turn to landscape mode or zoom in.)

Additional notes about the visualizations above:
* The large majority of the NYC measles cases are concentrated in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.
* Most of the NYC neighborhoods that have had at least one case of measles are in Brooklyn, but there are also neighborhoods in Queens (Flushing and Far Rockaway), and in the Bronx (Melrose, Longwood and Hunts Points).

### NYC Measles Cases by Age

The bar chart below shows the age distribution of NYC measles cases. Most of the cases are in children, particularly the ones aged from 1 to 4 years.

### NYC Measles Cases by Date

The graph below shows the NYC measles outbreak evolution over time, by comparing the number of **new** measles cases per month. Note that May 2019 is incomplete and is very likely to get more cases in the next data update.
