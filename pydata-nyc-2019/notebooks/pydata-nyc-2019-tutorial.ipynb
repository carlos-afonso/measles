    "__(1963)__ Before the measles vaccination program started in 1963, an estimated 3 to 4 million people got measles each year in the United States.\n",
    "* Of these, approximately 500,000 cases were reported each year to CDC; of these:\n",
    "    * 400 to 500 died,\n",
    "    * 48,000 were hospitalized, and\n",
    "    * 1,000 developed encephalitis (brain swelling).\n",

    "Since then, widespread use of measles virus-containing vaccine has led to a greater than 99% reduction in measles cases compared with the pre-vaccine era.\n",
    "\n",
    "__(2000)__ Measles was declared eliminated from the US in 2000, thanks to an effective vaccination program.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, measles is still common in other countries. Unvaccinated people continue to get measles while abroad and bring the disease into the United States and spread it to others.\n",
    "\n",
    "__(2019)__ The US is amid its largest measles outbreak since 1992, with 1,250 (preliminarily) confirmed cases as of Oct 3, 2019.\n",
